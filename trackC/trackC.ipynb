    "**Business problem.** Cyclistic launched a bike-share offering in Chicago in 2016, growing to 5,824 bikes across many stations. Three pricing plans are available: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Annual memberships are most profitable. There is interest in a marketing campaign to sell more annual memberships.\n",
